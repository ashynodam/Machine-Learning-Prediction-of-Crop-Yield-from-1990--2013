# Machine-Learning-Prediction-of-Crop-Yield-from-1990--2013
Advanced Crop Yield Prediction Using Machine Learning

In this project, I utilized machine learning models to predict crop yields based on various environmental and agricultural factors. By analyzing historical data, I developed a predictive system that can help farmers and policymakers make informed decisions to optimize agricultural productivity.

Key Features
🚜 Data Sources:
Leveraged data on rainfall, pesticide usage, average temperatures, crop type, and region to train predictive models.

🧠 Models Used:
Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge: Explored linear relationships to establish baseline models.
Decision Tree and KNN: Captured non-linear patterns to significantly improve prediction accuracy.

📈 Performance Highlights:
KNN emerged as the best-performing model with a MAE of ~4,693 and an R² score of 0.98, demonstrating exceptional accuracy in predicting crop yields.
Decision Tree also performed remarkably, with an R² score of 0.97, showcasing the potential of tree-based methods for this use case.

⚙️ Predictive System:
Built an intuitive system that allows users to input parameters (e.g., year, rainfall, temperature, crop type, region) and receive precise yield predictions instantly.

💾 Deployment:
Saved the trained models and preprocessing pipeline using pickle, enabling seamless deployment for real-world applications.

Impact
This project underscores how data-driven solutions can revolutionize agriculture, ensuring better resource allocation, minimizing waste, and maximizing yield potential.
